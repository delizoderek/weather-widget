# Weather Widget
The goal of this project was to build a weather widget that tells the user the current weather and 5 day forecast for a certain city. To do this, I used the openweather API to get the necessary information. Additional, functionality includes a history of cities searched and the ability to load weather data for those cities when they are clicked on.
